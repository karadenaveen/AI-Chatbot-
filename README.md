# 🧠 AI Chatbot for Cancer Complaint Tagging

A Generative AI-powered chatbot designed to classify unstructured medical complaints (e.g., patient issues or case descriptions) into a structured taxonomy using LLMs (Large Language Models). This system streamlines clinical data tagging by automating the classification into Complaint, Cause, and Correction categories.

# 🚀 Project Overview
This project uses LLMs (Ollama + OpenAI) along with LangChain to build an intelligent chatbot that accepts free-text inputs and classifies them into structured tags. It is optimized for cancer-related medical data and supports interactive, natural language conversations.

# 🧩 Key Features
✅ Classifies free-text clinical complaints into taxonomy: Complaint, Cause, and Correction

🤖 Built using LangChain, OpenAI GPT, and Ollama for LLM-based inference

📊 Automates EDA and Visualization of medical datasets using LLM prompts

🔍 Enables medical professionals to interact with data using natural language

🧠 Offline model inference using Ollama (local lightweight LLMs)

# 🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (for chatbot interface)

LLMs: OpenAI GPT-4, Ollama (local LLM inference)

Framework: LangChain (prompt engineering & agent workflow)

Data Analysis: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Visualization: LLM-generated plots based on natural language queries
